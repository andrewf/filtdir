Filtdir filters directories. That is, you give it a source directory and an
output directory, and for each file in the source, it runs an external
program you specify with three arguments:

 - $1: The the source directory
 - $2: The base file name of the source file
 - $3: The the output directory

It's up to you to make sure the program you supply writes to the correct
file. The reason this is not done automatically is so you have the flexibility
to change the filename or even not write it at all, if you decide not to.

You call it like ```filtdir srcdir destdir your_program```
